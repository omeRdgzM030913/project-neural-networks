# project-neural-networks
This repository shows a complete Deep Learning pipeline for classifying images from the FashionMNIST database, using PyTorch and two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The project compares the performance of both architectures using accuracy metrics, classification reporting, and confusion matrices.
